# ensembl-git-tools

A collection of tools which Ensembl uses to work with Git. These are split into the `bin` utilities which are useful general purposes scripts and `advanced_bin` which should be used with caution.

## Usage

To clone and to bring onto your bash path use the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-git-tools.git
export PATH=$PWD/ensembl-git-tools/bin:$PATH
```

To bring in the advanced commands also run
```
export PATH=$PWD/ensembl-git-tools/advanced_bin:$PATH
```

Now to use the commands you can either call them by their name or using the git syntax. Both examples are functionally equivalent.

```
git-ensembl --list

git ensembl --list
```

## Basic Commands

### git-ensembl

```
> git ensembl --list
[api] - API module set used for querying and processing Ensembl data
	ensembl (https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl.git)
	ensembl-compara (https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-compara.git)
	ensembl-funcgen (https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-funcgen.git)
	ensembl-variation (https://github.com/Ensembl/ensembl-variation.git)
....

> git ensembl clone api
... wait a bit ...
```

The ensembl tool is a way of performing tasks over multiple repositories which are grouped together. Currently we support:

- Cloning a set of repositories
- Switching the working branch (automatically creates remote tracking branches)
- Fetching new changes from origin (GitHub)
- Pulling in new changes from origin (fetching and merging into the current branch)

Groups can be found using the `--list` command which reports all available groups and the repositories they will work with.

#### Configuration

The `git-ensembl` command can be supplemented with user and global configuration allowing you to define new groups or override existing groups with new definitions. That configuration must be called `git-ensembl.groups` and can be located in `$HOME` or `~ensembl`. User based configuration will always win.

### git-mgw

```
git mgw --rebase
* MGW strategy is 'rebase'
* Source branch is 'dev'
* Target branch is 'master'
* OK to continue? (y/N)...
....
* DONE
```

MGW (Minimal Git Workflow) is a lightweight branching strategy developed by [Anacode at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://github.com/Anacode). It works by having developers never working on *master* but changes being applied to a local branch *dev*. When changes need to be released dev is rebased against master and then merged into master. 

This strategy encourages a fast-forward merges as well as a linear commit history. We call this the `--rebase` strategy. Alternatively should *dev* have been developed for so long that we want or need to maintain the parallel development history you can use the `--merge` strategy. This will enforce the creation of a commit merge even if a fast-forward merge was possible.

## Advanced Commands

### git-rewrite-authors

*This is an advanced command and should be used with caution*

```
> git rewrite-authors -list
Author: Some User <user@email.com>

> git rewrite-authors -old 'Some User <user@email.com>' -new 'New User <other@email.com>'
```

Rewrite authors is a tool for re-writing the history of a repository by scanning through the repository commit history and replacing the old username and email with the new one. This will result in new SHA-1 hashes being generated and so is a very unsafe operation to perform. Use with extreme caution.

### git-simplecvs

*This is an advanced command and should be used with caution*

```
> git simplecvs -cvs /path/to/cvs/dir --commitid HEAD^^ --dry-run
```

Simple CVS can be seen as a very simplified version of the Git command `git-cvsexportcommit`. If you need to maintain history *at all* please use that command instead of this one. This command makes no attempt at maintaining history preferring to scan Git for changes between the `--commitid` and `HEAD` of the current branch (you can specify a different `--target_commitid`). Files are copied or deleted according to Git and then added into CVS with a consistent message detailing the source and target hashes involved as well as the CVS and Git branches.
